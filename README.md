# Alloydb-Container-Extract
a set of scripts and instructions for extracting AlloyDB from a Docker container and manually deploying it as an independent service. The repository contains a step-by-step guide to:

Copying binaries and necessary files from the AlloyDB container.

Initialization of a new database cluster.

Configuring AlloyDB as a native system service.

Solving typical problems during extraction and startup.

The goal of the project is to make it possible to run AlloyDB without containers, for scenarios where manual control or integration into a nonâ€”standard infrastructure is required.
